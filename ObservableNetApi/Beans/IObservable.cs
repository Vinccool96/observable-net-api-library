///     An implementation of <c>IObservable</c> may support lazy evaluation, which means that the content is not
///     immediately
///     recomputed after changes, but lazily the next time it is requested. All binding and properties in this library
///     support lazy evaluation.
///     <para>
///         Implementations of this class should strive to generate as few events as possible to avoid wasting too much
///         time in
///         event handlers. Implementations in this library mark themselves as invalid when the first invalidation event
///         occurs.
///         They do not generate any more invalidation events until their value is recomputed and valid again.
